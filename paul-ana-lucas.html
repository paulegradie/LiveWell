    <!-- High‑Mortgage Scenario -->
    <section class="mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Option 1: High‑Mortgage Life</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">If Paul and Ana keep paying a large mortgage and maintain separate finances:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Over <strong>$130k</strong> per year goes to mortgage interest and principal repayment instead of building wealth.</li>
        <li>Disposable income is tied up, forcing compromises on travel, experiences and quality time with Lucas.</li>
        <li>The family remains vulnerable to interest rate hikes, job changes or unexpected expenses.</li>
        <li>Paul’s and Ana’s superannuation grows slowly because spare cash is tied up in the house.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">This traditional path achieves security eventually but delays the lifestyle they want now. Lucas misses out on travel and the couple continues to work hard to service debt.</p>
    </section>
    <!-- Joining the Trust Section -->
    <section class="mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Option 2: Joining the Family Trust</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Contributing their salaries to the trust and living on a modest allowance lets Paul and Ana accelerate wealth creation while still enjoying life:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>The couple deposits 100% of their income into the trust; the trust pays all household expenses and provides a monthly allowance starting around <strong>$2,500</strong>–<strong>$3,000</strong>.</li>
        <li>Their mortgage is eliminated by selling the family home; freed cash goes into income‑producing properties.</li>
        <li>The trust’s portfolio grows rapidly, enabling overseas holidays, quality time with Lucas and the resources to support his education.</li>
        <li>Big purchases like new phones, tablets or flights are funded by the trust’s surplus, not personal credit cards.</li>
        <li>Paul and Ana’s superannuation and the trust income compound together, giving them flexibility to retire earlier while providing stability for Lucas.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">This path requires an initial shift in mindset — living on a budget while the trust builds its base — but it pays off quickly. Within a few years the monthly allowances grow, debt is gone and the family enjoys more freedom.</p>
    </section>
    <!-- Timeline Section -->
    <section class="mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Timeline &amp; Experience</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Months 0–3:</strong> House sells; trust formed; debts paid; family temporarily downsizes while the buffer builds.</li>
        <li><strong>Month 4:</strong> Paul, Ana and Lucas move into a comfortable rental; begin living on their agreed allowance.</li>
        <li><strong>Years 1–2:</strong> Trust buys several investment properties; allowances inch upward as rents start flowing.</li>
        <li><strong>Years 3–5:</strong> Surplus cash funds overseas trips, visits to grandparents and exciting experiences for Lucas.</li>
        <li><strong>Years 6–10:</strong> The portfolio snowballs; allowances grow steadily; the family can consider buying their dream home outright if desired.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">Throughout the journey Paul and Ana remain key decision‑makers, with full transparency into trust finances. They still vote on major purchases and can draw larger sums for special occasions. The result is a life that balances present joy with future security.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Income &amp; Trust Growth Projections</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">These charts illustrate how Paul and Ana’s allowance evolves alongside the trust’s performance. Even
        though their initial allowance is modest, it grows as the trust compounds its investments.</p>

          <figcaption class="text-sm mt-2 text-gray-600">Paul and Ana start with an allowance of about $2,000 per month and see it climb
            gradually as the trust acquires more income‑producing assets. Major family purchases come from the trust’s
            surplus.</figcaption>
