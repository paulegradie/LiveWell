# Financial Strategy Planning - Dynamic Presentation

## 🎯 Project Overview
A sophisticated, visually stunning financial presentation designed to persuade family members about the benefits of a family trust strategy vs individual property purchases. The presentation uses dynamic visual effects, interactive calculators, and compelling financial data to demonstrate a $6.1M difference over 20 years.

## 🎨 Visual System Architecture

### Dynamic Background System
- **Technology**: CSS custom properties + JavaScript Intersection Observer
- **Color Palette**: Catppuccin Mocha (sophisticated, popular developer palette)
- **Effects**: 
  - 5 large blurred orbs (150px blur, 400-800px size)
  - Parallax movement based on scroll position
  - Smooth color transitions between sections
  - No solid backgrounds - orbs provide all visual differentiation

### Color Evolution Journey
```
Hero Section:     Red → Green (stop banks → start earning)
Problem Section:  Red → Maroon (financial stress)
Solution Section: Green → Teal (growth, fresh start)
Paul's Message:   Mauve → Blue (personal trust)
Lifestyle:        Mauve → Pink (luxury, joy)
How It Works:     Blue → Sapphire (clarity, process)
Final Choice:     Peach → Red (urgency, decision)
Family Trust:     Yellow → Purple (wealth, stability)
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Dynamic Section Loading
- `section-loader.js` loads all HTML sections dynamically
- Enables modular development and easy content updates
- Each section is a separate HTML file for maintainability

#### 2. Interactive Calculators
- **Mahnaz Calculator**: Apartment purchase scenario with sliders
- **Iraj Calculator**: Property purchase with AI income threat
- **Accordion Design**: Collapsed by default, user-controlled expansion
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant calculation updates as sliders move

#### 3. Dynamic Background Orbs
- **5 Orbs**: Different sizes, positions, animation timings
- **Parallax Effects**: Move at different speeds during scroll
- **Color Transitions**: Smooth changes based on section visibility
- **Performance**: Uses `will-change` and `transform3d` for GPU acceleration

#### 4. Responsive Design
- **Mobile-first**: Tailwind CSS responsive classes
- **Flexible Typography**: Scales from mobile to desktop
- **Touch-friendly**: Large interactive elements for mobile

- **Modular Sections**: Easy to edit individual content areas
- **Live Server**: Uses VS Code Live Server for development

## 📱 Browser Support
