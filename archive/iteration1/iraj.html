    <!-- Independent Living Section -->
    <section class="mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Option 1: Independent Living</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">If Iraj continues to live independently on his pension, he would:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Pay market rent of about <strong>$800/week</strong> (over <strong>$41k/year</strong>) for his own apartment.</li>
        <li>Cover all bills — utilities, phone, insurance, healthcare and groceries — from his modest pension and small savings.</li>
        <li>Watch his budget remain tight and fixed; there is no mechanism for his income to grow over time.</li>
        <li>Handle all housing issues, maintenance and administrative work himself.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">This provides maximum independence but leaves little buffer for travel, supporting family or weathering emergencies. Any change in costs directly reduces his quality of life.</p>
    </section>
    <!-- Joining the Trust Section -->
    <section class="mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Option 2: Joining the Family Trust</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Pooling his resources with the family trust gives Iraj stability and upside:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>He adds his savings and pension income to the trust; the trust covers his rent, utilities and insurance from day one.</li>
        <li>He receives a monthly allowance starting at <strong>$1,800</strong> and growing to <strong>$2,500</strong> as the trust grows.</li>
        <li>All housing, tax filings and maintenance are handled by the trust, freeing him from bureaucratic headaches.</li>
        <li>Emergency funds and travel budgets are available without dipping into his personal savings.</li>
        <li>As the portfolio expands, his allowance increases annually and he benefits from the same luxuries: family trips, new devices and peace of mind.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">By joining the trust, Iraj trades isolation and financial pressure for stability, growth and support. He remains in control of his lifestyle choices while sharing in a growing pool of resources.</p>
    </section>
    <!-- Timeline Section -->
    <section class="mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Timeline &amp; Experience</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">The trust grows steadily after inception. Iraj’s experience follows a similar arc to Mahnaz’s:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Months 0–3:</strong> Trust formation and initial buffer build; Iraj continues in his current accommodation.</li>
        <li><strong>Month 4:</strong> He moves into a trust‑funded apartment and begins receiving his monthly allowance.</li>
        <li><strong>Years 1–3:</strong> The trust acquires several high‑yield properties; his allowance edges up toward <strong>$2,500</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Years 4–10:</strong> Income growth accelerates, enabling generous travel, gifts and support for extended family without eroding capital.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">This path offers Iraj the dignity of choice and the security of shared resources. By working together, the family ensures everyone benefits from rising tides.</p>
