    <!-- What is the Trust -->
    <section class="mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">What is the Trust?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Our family trust is a corporate structure established to hold and manage all
        of our shared assets. It’s designed for both <strong>protection</strong> and
        <strong>growth</strong>. The trust is held <strong>90% in Ana’s name</strong> and
        <strong>10% in Paul’s name</strong> to maximise tax efficiency while keeping
        control within the family.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">We employ professional advisers and accountants to handle all the legal and
        administrative work. Companies like <em>Ramsay</em> and <em>TriForce</em> ensure that
        the trust complies with Australian law, files tax returns correctly and
        maintains proper records. This means beneficiaries never need to worry
        about paperwork or compliance.</p>

    <!-- How it Operates -->

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">How it Operates</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Income flows in:</strong> All rental income, pensions and salaries are
          deposited directly into the trust’s bank account.</li>
        <li><strong>Expenses are paid:</strong> The trust pays for property rates,
          insurance, maintenance and utilities as well as rent for beneficiaries
          who don’t own a home.</li>
        <li><strong>Allowances are distributed:</strong> Each beneficiary receives a
          monthly allowance agreed by the family (e.g. Mahnaz starts at
          $2,500/month, Iraj at $1,800/month, Paul & Ana around $2,500–$3,000).
          These allowances are for personal living costs; housing and taxes are
          handled by the trust.</li>
        <li><strong>Surplus is reinvested:</strong> Any money left over after
          allowances and expenses is used to purchase new high‑yield rental
          properties. This reinvestment causes the trust’s income to grow
          steadily over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Professionally managed:</strong> Accountants prepare the trust’s
          financial statements and tax returns. Trustees (Ana and Paul) approve
          major decisions like buying or selling properties.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent and inclusive:</strong> Beneficiaries may access
          statements and choose how involved they want to be in investment
          decisions. Extra funds can be requested for emergencies or special
          occasions without disrupting the overall plan.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Why It’s Safe and Beneficial -->
    <section class="mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Why It’s Safe and Beneficial</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Asset protection:</strong> A corporate trust separates personal
          liabilities from trust assets. Creditors can’t claim trust property if
          an individual runs into trouble.</li>
        <li><strong>Tax efficiency:</strong> Allocating 90% ownership to Ana and 10%
          to Paul allows distributions to be channelled to the lower tax
          bracket. This means more of the income stays in the family.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional oversight:</strong> Experienced accountants and
          advisers ensure compliance with the law and manage complex tasks like
          tax filings and property settlements.</li>
        <li><strong>Growing income:</strong> Because the trust reinvests surplus
          cash, the rental income grows year after year. This allows the
          allowances to increase instead of shrink over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility and control:</strong> Beneficiaries retain the
          right to draw extra funds for emergencies or family support without
          worrying about interest rates or bank approvals.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">For someone like Mahnaz, this structure removes the burden of managing a
        property and worrying about bills. She simply receives her monthly
        allowance, which grows over time, while knowing there is always a
        substantial safety net available. It’s a way to enjoy a secure and
        comfortable life while helping the whole family prosper.</p>
