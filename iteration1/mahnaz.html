    <!-- Independent Retirement Section -->
    <section class="mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Option 1: Independent Retirement</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">If Mahnaz decides to sell the family home, buy an apartment and live off her
        superannuation and pension, this is what her life could look like:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>She would receive roughly <strong>$840k</strong> from her share of the house sale.</li>
        <li>She’d need to purchase an apartment outright and cover ongoing costs like council rates, body corporate fees, maintenance and insurance.</li>
        <li>Her income would come from her <strong>$250k</strong> superannuation balance and her government pension (~$550/week).</li>
        <li>With costs rising and income fixed, her savings would slowly diminish over time.</li>
        <li>She would be responsible for paying all bills, organising maintenance and managing her own tax paperwork.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">This path offers independence, but her income never grows. Any unexpected expense — a
        medical bill or helping family overseas — comes directly from her shrinking nest egg.</p>

    <!-- Joining the Trust Section -->
    <section class="mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Option 2: Joining the Family Trust</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">By pooling her proceeds into the family trust, Mahnaz unlocks a growing income
        and complete peace of mind:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>She contributes her sale proceeds into the trust and keeps <strong>$50k</strong> in her personal account for comfort.</li>
        <li>She stays with Jameleh for a few months while the initial buffer is built, then moves into a comfortable apartment with rent and utilities paid by the trust.</li>
        <li>She receives a monthly allowance that starts at <strong>$2,500</strong> and gradually rises to <strong>$3,500</strong> per month as the trust grows.</li>
        <li>Her allowance is purely for personal living expenses – the trust handles rent, rates, insurance, tax filings and major repairs.</li>
        <li>As a beneficiary, she always has visibility into trust accounts and can request extra funds for emergencies or special trips.</li>
        <li>The trust’s investments generate increasing cash flow each year, enabling bigger family travel budgets, business‑class flights, new phones or tablets and ongoing support for Lucas’s education.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">This path protects Mahnaz’s savings, provides ever‑increasing income and eliminates the stress of managing property. She remains in control — deciding how involved she wants to be — while enjoying a simpler, more abundant life.</p>
    </section>
    <!-- Timeline Section -->
    <section class="mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Timeline &amp; Experience</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">After the house sells, the trust pays off all debts and builds a cash buffer. Over the
        next few years it purchases high‑yield rental properties that produce steady income:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Months 0–3:</strong> Sale settles; Mahnaz stays with Jameleh while we secure a rental apartment and build the trust buffer.</li>
        <li><strong>Month 4:</strong> She moves into her new apartment and begins receiving her monthly allowance.</li>
        <li><strong>Years 1–3:</strong> The trust buys two to three investment properties; her allowance increases gradually.</li>
        <li><strong>Years 4–10:</strong> The portfolio snowballs, enabling upgrades like business‑class travel, better devices and regular gifts to family abroad while the principal continues to grow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">Throughout this journey Mahnaz never worries about surprise bills or downturns — the trust’s liquidity buffer and professional advisers ensure stability. Her legacy helps build a better future for Lucas while securing her own comfort.</p>
