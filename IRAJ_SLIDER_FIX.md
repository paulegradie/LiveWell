# 🔧 IRAJ SLIDER FIX - COMPLETED

## 🐛 Problem Identified
The Iraj calculator sliders weren't updating properly because the JavaScript was trying to update a non-existent element.

## ✅ Fix Applied
**File**: `script.js` (lines 1328-1333)

**Issue**: The code was trying to update an element with ID `irajYearlyText` that doesn't exist in the HTML:
```javascript
document.getElementById('irajYearlyText').textContent = `$${(totalSavings/1000)}k ÷ 20 years = $${Math.round(yearlyFromSavings/1000)}k/year`;
```

**Solution**: Removed the problematic line since that yearly breakdown isn't displayed in the current UI design.

## 🎯 What Should Work Now
All Iraj calculator sliders should now properly update their corresponding display values:

### Main Sliders
- ✅ **Property Cost Slider** → Updates `irajPropertyCost`
- ✅ **Super Amount Slider** → Updates `irajSuperAmount` 
- ✅ **Tutoring Income Slider** → Updates `irajTutoringValue`

### Expense Sliders
- ✅ **Food** → Updates `irajFoodValue`
- ✅ **Council Rates** → Updates `irajCouncilValue`
- ✅ **Utilities** → Updates `irajUtilitiesValue`
- ✅ **Body Corporate** → Updates `irajBodycorpValue`
- ✅ **Insurance** → Updates `irajInsuranceValue`
- ✅ **Phone/Internet** → Updates `irajPhoneValue`
- ✅ **Medical** → Updates `irajMedicalValue`
- ✅ **Transportation** → Updates `irajTransportValue`

### Calculated Values
- ✅ **Total Monthly Basics** → Updates `irajTotalBasics`
- ✅ **Money Left Over** → Updates `irajLeftoverMonthly`
- ✅ **Total Monthly Income** → Updates `irajTotalMonthlyIncome`
- ✅ **Financial Status** → Updates `irajFinancialStatus`

## 🧪 Testing Instructions
1. Open the presentation in a browser with a local server
2. Navigate to the "What's Standing In Our Way?" section
3. Expand the "Iraj's Retirement Reality" accordion
4. Move any slider and verify the corresponding numbers update immediately
5. Check that the "Money Left Over" calculation changes as you adjust expenses

## 🎯 Expected Behavior
- **Real-time updates**: All numbers should change instantly as sliders move
- **Persistent state**: Slider positions should be saved and restored on page reload
- **AI warning**: Should appear/disappear based on tutoring income slider
- **Status messages**: Should update based on financial calculations

---

**STATUS**: ✅ **FIXED** - Iraj calculator sliders should now work perfectly!

The fix was simple but critical - removing the reference to a non-existent HTML element that was causing the update function to fail silently.
