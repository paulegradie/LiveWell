**Title: A Family Wealth Strategy for Early Retirement, Asset Protection, and Long-Term Passive Income**

**Overview**
Paul and Ana are in a uniquely powerful financial position, bolstered by high incomes, a strong property portfolio, and support from family members Mahnaz and Iraj. With careful planning, they can eliminate debt, build a property empire inside a discretionary trust, and create sustainable, inflation-hedged income that eventually replaces Paul's active income entirely.

This strategy will use a trust with a corporate trustee (where Ana is the majority beneficiary and Paul has discretionary distribution rights), and prioritize long-term wealth retention, tax efficiency, asset protection, and lifestyle freedom. All personal incomes, pensions, and rental income will flow into the trust, which will operate as the central hub for managing expenses, acquisitions, and growth.

**Stage 1: Debt Elimination & Trust Establishment**

*Objective:* Simplify the current structure by removing high-interest liabilities and consolidate ownership under a tax-advantaged, flexible structure.

* Mahnaz and Iraj sell their \$2.0M home with \$400k debt. After agent and legal fees (\~\$70k), they net approximately **\$1.53M**.
* Use this to:

  * Pay off all debts on Paul and Ana's three properties:

    * \$850k (home)
    * \$520k (property 1)
    * \$429k (property 2)
    * **Total: \$1.799M**, shortfall of \~\$270k
  * Bridge this gap from:

    * Mahnaz's \$200k super (available next year)
    * Iraj's updated savings (\$60k total)
    * Paul's anticipated equity release of **\$150,000 USD (\~\$225,000 AUD)** in 2 years

These combined resources more than cover the shortfall. Now, all three properties are debt-free and can generate powerful cash flow inside a **discretionary trust**.

Note: After this step, the trust will have minimal cash reserves. It will not be immediately possible to build the granny flat in cash.

**Stage 2: Rental Income Engine + Strategic Growth**

*Objective:* Maximize rental yield, prioritize rent growth, avoid CGT, and reinvest tax-optimized income.

* Estimated current gross rental income:

  * Property 1: \$620/week (\$32,240/year)
  * Property 2: \$520/week (\$27,040/year)
  * Granny flat: \$500/week (\$26,000/year) — **not yet built**
  * **Total (without granny flat): \~\$59,280/year gross, growing 5% annually**

* After minimal operating expenses (10%), and no debt service, this becomes **\~\$53,352/year in net free cash flow**

**Family Housing Costs and Net Surplus:**

* **If Mahnaz and Iraj each rent a premium apartment at \$800/week:**

  * Combined rent = \$1,600/week = \$6,400/month = \$76,800/year

* **Paul and Ana's general monthly costs:**

  * \$4,000/month = \$48,000/year

* **Additional distributions:**

  * Mahnaz monthly stipend: \$2,000/month = \$24,000/year
  * Iraj monthly stipend: \$2,000/month = \$24,000/year

* **Optional discretionary lifestyle spending:**

  * Monthly flights to Brisbane (averaging \$400/month)
  * Overseas family support: \$800/month = \$9,600/year
  * Yearly Christmas getaway (Airbnb rentals, family-wide): \$10,000/year
  * Major international trip in 3 years (Europe/US): \$40,000 (allocate \$1,100/month toward this for next 36 months)

* **Total essential and discretionary outflows: \~\$232,800/year**

**Total Trust Inflows (Post-Stage 1):**

* Net rental income (no granny flat): \$53,352/year
* Ana’s salary: \$60,000/year
* Iraj’s pension: \$26,400/year
* Paul’s salary: \$202,000/year
* **Combined total inflows: \$341,752/year**

**Annual Net Surplus Available for Reinvestment:**

* \$341,752 – \$232,800 = **\$108,952/year (\~\$9,079/month)**

**Short-Term Objective: Build the Granny Flat**

* Estimated cost to build: **\$260,000**
* Financing options:

  * If urgent, a short-term construction loan could be taken (e.g., \$260k @ \~6% interest only = \~\$15,600/year in interest, or \~\$1,300/month)
  * This would reduce surplus but is serviceable within the trust’s \~\$11k/month surplus
  * Preferred approach: **save up and fund the build in cash within 13–14 months**. This aligns well with the expected timeline, as it will take approximately 12 months to obtain plans and council approvals before construction can begin.

Once built, the granny flat adds \~\$26,000/year in rent (growing 5% annually), improving trust cash flow and supporting further acquisitions.

**Stage 3: Strategic and Sustainable Property Growth**

*Objective:* Gradually acquire high-yield properties in a manner that supports lifestyle comfort and long-term financial independence.

* With Paul continuing to work for several more years, the trust will focus on maintaining a high standard of living for all family members while accumulating capital at a strong pace.
* Trust surpluses (\~\$9,000/month after lifestyle expenses) will be pooled toward purchasing **1 affordable, high-yield rental property every 18–20 months**, priced around \$300,000 each, while also ensuring the trust distributes at least \$2,000/month each to Mahnaz and Iraj for personal living expenses and lifestyle needs.
* Each new property is expected to generate \$25,000–\$35,000 per year in net rent
* Reinvesting growing rental income compounds future acquisitions
* This strategy ensures family comfort and cohesion while still growing passive income to replace Paul’s active earnings over time

**Property Selection Preferences:**

* Target suburbs with high rental demand, low vacancy, and infrastructure growth
* Favor dual-income setups or properties with expansion/renovation potential

---

**Stage 4: Accumulation via Cash Purchases**

*Objective:* Use trust to acquire more rental properties without debt.

* With no debt drag, rising rent income, equity releases, and combined family surplus, aim to buy **1–2 properties every 1.5–2 years**
* Assume each purchase adds \$25k–\$35k/year in rent
* Within 10 years, you could own 8–10 properties, generating \$250k–\$350k in passive income

---

**Stage 5: Income Splitting & Paul's Retirement**

*Objective:* Phase Paul out of work while maintaining or increasing net household income.

* As rental income climbs past \$200k:

  * Use **income splitting** within the trust to direct most income to Ana, Mahnaz, or even adult children (future-proofing)
  * Leave some income in the trust to reinvest (taxed at 30%)
  * Keep Paul as a non-income-receiving controller (asset protection, zero marginal tax)

* Result: Paul retires, household keeps strong income, and tax efficiency improves.

---

**Key Principles**

* Never sell unless tax impact is neutral or positive
* Retain ownership for **CGT discount** and capital growth
* Use **company-as-trustee + discretionary trust** for control, flexibility, and protection
* Direct maximum income to lowest-taxed family members
* Reinvest all spare cash into new income-producing assets
* Sustain a lifestyle that keeps every family member comfortable, empowered, and bought in

---

**10-Year Vision**

* Debt-free principal residence
* \$300k+ in passive income from 10+ properties
* Mahnaz and Iraj in premium rentals with discretionary spending
* Paul free to stop working permanently by choice
* Family travels annually with intercontinental trips every few years
* Overseas family members supported with monthly stipends
* Wealth protected, diversified, and generationally structured

This isn’t just a plan for early retirement — it’s a blueprint for intergenerational financial freedom with a rich and fulfilling lifestyle along the way.
