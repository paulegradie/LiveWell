This is an empty repository that I would like to turn into an html page that will take us on a financial journey. This website needs to be really expressive - artisitic almost - modern and minimalist with deep rich colors like purples that are slightly neon so to speak with contrasting bright vibrant colors for highlights. It should be a single page - that scrolls down (with navigation anchors and a side bar to jump between regions (I refrain frmo saying 'sections' - this should be fluid and continuous in nature).

The subject is our financial story. I'll share with you two images you can try to use for reference: the first is how things will play out if we do not work together as a family to eliminate debt and save nearly 170 thousand dollars every year to interest - image you're giving 170 thousand dollars every year to someone you know presonally and really despise. The second image is how things will play out if we work together and take some action.

This is central message: I am your leader towards a really comfortable luxurious future. What could have been is suddenly possible once more. Thanks to intense and focused investment by Paul. We have an opportunity before us that will complete change the course of our lives.

The presentation of the website will be very similar to how github.com looks - but perhaps with more animations. It is critical that the style look extremely polished and professional and that there are no formatting issues on either mobile, table, or desktop. I suggest using tailwindcss for this.

Neat, organized - with a professional font and style throughout.

What we explain is the following:

# If we fly solo

- we will need to service our own debts
- pay enormous amounts of money to the bank

Consider the following portfolio and income statement for the family as it stands today:

## Property Portfolio

| Property                | Debt        | Value     | Bank Fee per month | Bank fees per year    |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| 52 High Street          | $400k       | $2.1m     | $2,800             | $33,600               |
| 75 Peter                | $850k       | $1.8m     | $5,000             | $60,000               |

| (Granny Flat next year) | -           | -         | -                  | -                     |
| **Total**               | **$2,199k** | **$5.2m** | **$13,800**        | **$144,000** PER YEAR |

## Family Income & Tax Summary

| Person    | Income Type | Income    | Tax         | What you keep |
| --------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Paul      | Salary      | $202k     | $72,788     | $129,212      |
| Paul      | Rental      | $30k      | -           | $30,000       |
| Ana       | Salary      | $60k      | $17,788     | $42,212       |
| Ana       | Rental      | $30k      | -           | $30,000       |
| Iraj      | Pension     | $24k      | $0          | $24,000       |
| Mahnaz    | Super       | $10k      | $0          | $10,000       |
| **Total** | -           | **$356k** | **$90,576** | **$265,424**  |

## The plan

The current plan is to sell the house when Mahnaz retires maybe hopefully for around 2 million dollars - pay off the 400,000 outstanding - and reclaim 1.6 million dollars in the bank. Currently depreciating at about 2% per year - so each year 1.6 million becomes 1.568 million becomes 1.536 million and so on.

The plan is to then split that money between Mahnaz and Iraj. Until then, it costs 36,000 per year to service the debt. That means over the last 3 years (while I've been trying to get you all to pivot) you have pissed away $108,000. That could have been used for travel, shopping, and general living expenses, or investing to grow the family's wealth.

### Mahnaz

Mahnaz intends to buy an apartment, and then live off her 200k superannuation. This needs to last 20 years, so thats 10,000 per year in living expense. This means that Mahnaz is extremely cash poor and will be dependent on everyone around her for short term expenses, as well as long term old-age care, putting an enormous financial burden and strain on the family (regardless of who looks after her). In other words - Mahnaz will not be able to contibute towards anything that requires money. Others will be required to pay for lodging, travel, food, an anything else that she wants to do. Due to inflation, her 200k will not last 20 years - it will likely last closer to 10-15 years. We will see later how this compounds the negative impact of this general approach - but for now it is important to understand that with these decisions, Mahnaz will be a significant financial drain on the family for the foreseeable future.

### Iraj

Iraj intends to either buy a luxury apartment in the GoldCoast, or rent a modest apartment here in Melbourne. If Iraj rents, he will have both his pension of 24k as well as 800k proceed from the sale of 52 High Street to pay rent, and spend as he pleases. Although very clever - Iraj is a reformed gambling addict, and tends to make poor long-term financial decisions. So leaving him with 800k in the bank is a relatively high risk for substantial financial loss. If Iraj is responsible, he will have enough money for a yearly salary of $69,000 / year ($5777/month). This will be enough to pay a comfortable high end rent, while leaving a couple thousand per month for general living. Without saving, Iraj will also be a financial drain on an already taxed and stretched family. Mahnaz won't be able to contribute, so Paul and Ana will be required to support him. Paul and Ana may also need to support Mahnaz.

## What this means for Ana, Lucas and Paul

Ana continues to work part time for the foreseeable future. Maxing out at probably less than 40k/yr after tax. She bears the weight of much home life responsiblity because she is the main steward of the kids. Paul is forced to maintain an extremely intense schedule and poor worklife balance because he is the main breadwinner in a family that has decided to endure an active income approach to financial planning. Paul is going to be typically frustrated with this situation and will continue to suffer from burnout. Its not clear how long Paul will be able to keep up the high earnings he is currently making.

It will take Paul and Ana many years to convert ther investments into a substantial net positive income - 5-10 years at least before there is substantial cashflow. This investment is critial to Paul and Ana's future - to provide financial stability and security for themselves and their children. There will be no money left for travel, shopping, or general living expenses or luxury goods. We will be wealthy, but extremely cash poor and with high tax exposure (since the only way to produce positive cash flow is to sell assets - which is taxed). We pay over 1.4 million in bank fees - money that could have other wise been given to Lucas for his future.

Lucas will not get to experience life to the extent that Ivy does, since that means trading Ana and Pauls future. Ana continues to work in to old age, as does Paul - if this is even a possibility. With the emergence of extremely sophisticated AI - it is likely that Paul will be pushed out of the market. He can't continue to rapidly adapt forever. Its f\*\*cking exhausting and extremely hard. My finger joints WILL go from typing. And my eyesight will too.

This is what we'll get if we make this poor decision:

## Individual Financial Position if we do not work together

| Person        | Total Earnings | Tax Paid    | Housing Costs | Left Over   |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Paul          | $159,212       | $72,788     | $66,000       | $20,424     |
| Ana           | $64,212        | $17,788     | $66,000       | -$19,576    |
| Iraj (rents)  | $104,000       | $0          | $36,000       | $68,000     |
| Mahnaz (buys) | $10,000        | $0          | $0            | $10,000     |
| **Total**     | **$337,424**   | **$90,576** | **$168,000**  | **$78,848** |

** All of the capital that could be used to general passive income evaporates - pissed away to the wind - a once in a lifetime opportunity is lost**

---

Now Augment, I'd like you to draw a mermaid diagram if you can here so that we can visualse and see the flow of money and how much we stand to lose if we all decide to go our own way and buy our own properties. based on this story.

This is an extremely lame plan and leaves us all miserable and hating one another because we're always stressed about money. Mahnaz dies before we have enough to enjoy it. Iraj dies before then too. Ana and Paul are left here with Lucas depressed and miserable - and now we have an apartment we have either rent it out, or sell it in under two years else pay a capitcal gains tax to sell it - and you have to decide even who will inheret it. Same thing for Iraj.

---

## An alternate decision that we can make

Instead - we should do something different. Something with no risk. Something that will ensure that we all have a comfortable future.

There is going to be a local suurge in housing prices in the next 6-12 months. They are already rising rapidly. This is due to the recent critical

- Sell the house and collect 1.6 million dollars. Mahnaz stays with Gemela for 3 months, Iraj stays with Paul and Ana for 3 months. We immediately pay off 100% of 75 Peter, 73 Willow, and the rest into the 122 Maitland property

## After Debt Payoff Strategy

| Property     | Original Debt | Amount Paid Off | New Debt  | New Bank Fee monthly | Value     |
| ------------ | ------------- | --------------- | --------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| 75 Peter     | $850k         | $850k           | $0        | $0                   | $1.8m     |
| 73 Willow    | $520k         | $520k           | $0        | $0                   | $740k     |
| 122 Maitland | $429k         | $230k           | $199k     | $1,194               | $560k     |
| **Total**    | **$1,799k**   | **$1,600k**     | **$199k** | **$1,194**           | **$3.1m** |

**Funds Used:** $1.6 million from 52 High Street sale
**Remaining Debt:** $199k (down from $2,199k)
**Annual Bank Fee Savings:** $12,606 (from $13,800 to $1,194)

## New Family Income Position

| Person    | Income Type | Income    | Tax         | What you keep |
| --------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Paul      | Salary      | $202k     | $72,788     | $129,212      |
| Paul      | Rental      | $30k      | -           | -$8,000       |
| Ana       | Salary      | $60k      | $17,788     | $42,212       |
| Ana       | Rental      | $30k      | -           | -$8,000       |
| Iraj      | Pension     | $24k      | $0          | $24,000       |
| Mahnaz    | Super       | $10k      | $0          | $10,000       |
| **Total** | -           | **$356k** | **$90,576** | **$265,424**  |

**Annual Savings from Debt Elimination:** $12,606 in bank fees
**Available for Investment/Lifestyle:** $265,424 + $12,606 = **$278,030 per year**

Interest rates will LIKELY stabalize at around 5.5% for the foreseeable future.

This is what we get if we make the smart decision

- Iraj will be entitled to up to 12 round-trip flights to Queensland a year. Enabling one trip per month.
- Mahnaz gets access to 20,000 per year for shopping
- Paul gets his Electic Drumkit so he can play drums again
- Ana gets to travel the world with her family
- We all get to go on family trips without worrying about money
- Paul gets to step off the gas and take some time to heal

## Individual Financial Position - After Smart Decision and we DO work together

| Person         | Total Earnings | Tax Paid    | Housing Costs | Left Over    |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Paul           | $232,000       | $72,788     | $14,394       | $145,018     |
| Ana            | $90,000        | $17,788     | $0            | $72,212      |
| Iraj (rents)   | $24,000        | $0          | $18,000       | $6,000       |
| Mahnaz (rents) | $40,500        | $0          | $0            | $10,000      |
| **Total**      | **$356,000**   | **$90,576** | **$19,194**   | **$233,230** |

**Annual improvement over flying solo: $154,382 more available for lifestyle and investment**
(From $78,848 flying solo to $233,230 working together)

From 233k/yr

- Mahnaz gets to rent a very nice apartment and have lots of spending money
- Iraj gets to rent a very nice apartment and have lots of spending money
  - Who knows - maybe we even get back into the Mahagony room :P
- Paul and Ana will manage the properties with Ramsey and the property managers - we'll quickly save up enormous deposits to purchase additional properties and have them fully paid off rapidly
- We'll book NICE end of year holidays for once - 10k on the holiday house and bribane rentals or even hotels for 2 weeks instead of these shitty, 1-room, no-view, no-pool rentals for these damn trips. They suck! Everyone gets a damn master bedroom EACH with AC. Think of Amir! of Maman Bozourgh.

Thats 19k/person per year (with Paul and Ana working until old age) VS. 61.5k/yr where there is no finaicial stress AT ALL.

- PLEASE do not be selfish - to satisfy your own desire to no have to depend on anyone. I really don't want you to think of think of this like its a dependency. I'm looking at this like a SHARED resource. You can have a monthly transfer to a personal account if you want - can take out more if you need, we'll budge standard stuff like shopping and trips to queensland - we'll basically have a TRUST that we can all sahre in - we can use it to accumulate more properties and I'll dedicate my income to accumulating enough properties to eventual replace all income streams.

Lucas (and if we have a second kid) will be able to do what they want and live their lives without having to worry about money. They can try a career and always have a fallback managing the property portfolio - which we'll just continue to grow over generations.

Our generation will be able to really enjoy our lives, Lucas (and other kid maybe) will be able to start a family sooner and they'll be rich. His kids will be very wealthy - generational wealth begun and thats our legacy and gift to them. Paul can relax for once.

## Final Comparison: Flying Solo vs Working Together

| Person        | Flying Solo Left Over | Working Together Left Over | Annual Improvement |
| ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Paul          | $20,424               | $158,018                   | **+$137,594**      |
| Ana           | -$19,576              | $72,212                    | **+$91,788**       |
| Iraj (buys)   | $6,000                | $6,000                     | $0                 |
| Mahnaz (buys) | $10,000               | $10,000                    | $0                 |
| **Total**     | **$78,848**           | **$246,230**               | **+$167,382**      |

**The choice is clear: Working together transforms financial stress into financial freedom.**

### All Mahnaz and Iraj need to do for this to work

- Sell the house after prices surge for 2.0 - 2.1 million (as much as possible!) and put the proceeds into our properties
- Rent an apartment wherever you'd like for up to $800-1000/week

We get to live a cash-rich lifestyle while preserving millions in capital for our generations future.

Please don't take that away from us. Mona and Alex got 300k 10 years ago. They mostly pissed it away. We started -140k with no help. Please create this opportunity with us. We'll auto-deposit 'salaries' into accounts - you can always access additional funds if you need them. But please - let's not piss this away. Let's build something special. I want us to be able to do things without having to always go so goddamn cheap and without having to sacrifice our future. IT IT NOT GUARANTEED THAT I WILL ALWAYS MAKE THIS MUCH MONEY. We need to ACT while I'm making this much. AI is coming for my position and its coming fast. The next generation is also coming and I don't think I'll be able to keep up for long into the future. We NEED to convert our potential into reality here and we need to do it now.

Okay Augment - this is the story - I hope it makes sense. We're trying to convince our parents to understand this financial opportunity we have and not squander it and fuck up their kid's future by being selfish and let their feelings cause them to make a really really bad decision. The banks WANT us to make this fuck up. Lets not do it.

I want this story to be presented in the webpage that we will create and share with our parents. Can you help me with this? It needs to be animated, possibly interactive even - like you can have interactive elements with a slider that you can move to see the different scenarios play out. Maybe a toggle to go between different cases like 'work together - don't work together' or something to that effect. I want you to create a details design document that you can then follow to create this webpage. Be consistent and pelase ensure the formattings a styles are good. Use interesting and ledgible - LARGE for old people (they are 60s and 70s). 


Additinal thoughts:

If we do this, we can take out a crazy life insurance plan on me in case I die - you will all be crazy loaded. plz don't murder me.
