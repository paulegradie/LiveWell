    <!-- What is the Trust -->
    <section id="what" class="mb-10">
      <section class="mb-10">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">1. What it is: The Family Trust</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">A trust is a legal entity that holds assets for the benefit of
          beneficiaries. Its essentially a glorified bank account (but a bit more complex).</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Our family trust is a corporate structure established to hold and manage all
          of our shared assets. It’s designed for both <strong>protection</strong> and
          <strong>growth</strong>. The trust is held <strong>90% in Ana’s name</strong> and
          <strong>10% in Paul’s name</strong> to maximise tax efficiency while keeping
          control within the family. To ensure that pensions remain unaffected, both
          Mahnaz and Iraj disassociate themselves from legal ownership of the trust’s
          assets, instead receiving regular allowances as beneficiaries.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">We employ professional advisers and accountants to handle all the legal and
          administrative work. Companies like <em>Ramsay</em> and <em>TriForce</em> ensure that
          the trust complies with Australian law, files tax returns correctly and
          maintains proper records. This means beneficiaries never need to worry
          about paperwork or compliance.</p>
        <p>
          <bold>Reality Check:</bold> Paul and Ana give $120,000 to the bank each year - we'd rather put it into our shared security blanket Trust

      <!-- How it Operates -->
      <section id="operate" class="mb-10">
        <section class="mb-10">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">2. How it works: Flow of money and decisions</h2>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Income flows in:</strong> All rental income, pensions and salaries are
              deposited directly into the trust’s bank account.</li>
            <li><strong>Expenses are paid:</strong> The trust pays for property rates,
              insurance, maintenance and utilities as well as rent for beneficiaries
              who don’t own a home.</li>
            <li><strong>Allowances are distributed:</strong> Each beneficiary receives a
              monthly allowance agreed by the family (e.g. Mahnaz starts at
              $2,500/month, Iraj at $1,800/month, Paul & Ana around $2,500–$3,000).
              These allowances are for personal living costs; housing and taxes are
              handled by the trust.</li>
            <li><strong>Surplus is reinvested:</strong> Any money left over after
              allowances and expenses is used to purchase new high‑yield rental
              properties. This reinvestment causes the trust’s income to grow
              steadily over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Professionally managed:</strong> Accountants prepare the trust’s
              financial statements and tax returns. Trustees (Ana and Paul) approve
              major decisions like buying or selling properties.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparent and inclusive:</strong> Beneficiaries may access
              statements and choose how involved they want to be in investment
              decisions. Extra funds can be requested for emergencies or special
              occasions without disrupting the overall plan.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <!-- Why It’s Safe and Beneficial -->
        <section id="benefits" class="mb-10">
          <section class="mb-10">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">3. Why it’s good: Safe, simple, beneficial</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
              <li><strong>Asset protection:</strong> A corporate trust separates personal
                liabilities from trust assets. Creditors can’t claim trust property if
                an individual runs into trouble.</li>
              <li><strong>Tax efficiency:</strong> Allocating 90% ownership to Ana and 10%
                to Paul allows distributions to be channelled to the lower tax
                bracket. This means more of the income stays in the family.</li>
              <li><strong>Professional oversight:</strong> Experienced accountants and
                advisers ensure compliance with the law and manage complex tasks like
                tax filings and property settlements.</li>
              <li><strong>Growing income:</strong> Because the trust reinvests surplus
                cash, the rental income grows year after year. This allows the
                allowances to increase instead of shrink over time.</li>
              <li><strong>Flexibility and control:</strong> Beneficiaries retain the
                right to draw extra funds for emergencies or family support without
                worrying about interest rates or bank approvals.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4">For someone like Mahnaz, this structure removes the burden of managing a
              property and worrying about bills. She simply receives her monthly
              allowance, which grows over time, while knowing there is always a
              substantial safety net available. It’s a way to enjoy a secure and
              comfortable life while helping the whole family prosper.</p>

              <p class="mb-4">Seeing is believing. The trust invests surplus income into new properties
                and keeps living allowances growing steadily. The charts below
                summarise how the trust is expected to operate over the next decade
                based on the plan we’ve outlined.</p>

                    month. Mahnaz and Iraj’s payments plateau once they reach
                    comfortable levels, allowing more funds to flow back into the trust.</figcaption>

                    grows slowly, reflecting their long‑term view. Major purchases for

                    the trust as needed.</figcaption>

                    $3,500 per month. She never pays rent out of her own pocket, and
                    her allowance reflects only day‑to‑day living costs.</figcaption>
