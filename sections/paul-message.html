                        <p>
                            I've been thinking about our family's financial future, and I realized something important: 
                            we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity right now.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Instead of everyone struggling individually with mortgages and retirement planning, 
                            we can work together to create something much bigger and better for all of us.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="text-xl font-semibold text-cyan-bright">
                            This isn't just about money - it's about family, freedom, and creating the life we all deserve.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            I want Mahnaz and Iraj to have comfortable retirements. I want us to take amazing family trips. 
                            I want Grammy to be well cared for. And I want Lucas to have a strong financial foundation.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="text-xl font-bold text-green-success">
                            We can make all of this happen - and we don't have to wait.
